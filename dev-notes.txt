To allow a customer to specify policies for their outgoing traffic. They make route advertisements
with both source and destination IP addreses specified, and link their network policies in the route
.

When SDX received such route that has both src and dst ip addreses, it check if there are matching
routes (i.e. the same src and dst IP pair) from the other direction.

1. If there is no such matching routes, do nothing

2. If there is matching routes, but all doesn't match. Do nothing

3. If there is matching routes and the whole path, which is the conjunction of paths in the two
advertisements are compliant to network policies of both customers, configure the routing.

4. If there is matching routes, with IP prefixes a super set of the IP addresses in the route (For
example, a matching route with only destination addresses specified), but the whole path are not
compliant to the sender's outgoing policies. We need to explicitly install a blocking rule to block
the traffic. Q: Is this necessary, as we assume that the sender won't send traffic to uncompliant
paths. Seems to be not necessary.


How do we verify the whole path?
1. Conjunct the path
2. Link certificates  of both routes to fetch the credentials of all ASes on the path, and the
policies of both customer networks
3.

route(Alice, aliceIP, Bob, bobIP, path):-
   Alice: route(aliceIP, bobIP, path),
   Bob: route(bobIP, aliceIP, path)
